Heavy surf and high winds throughout the next several days made boarding the vessel difficult and dangerous. While the preferred option was to salvage the vessel with the oil on board, the Unified Command requested that contingency plans for vessel lightering, cleanup and pollution response be developed.

By February 9, oil was ashore at Huntington Beach; in some instances, oil in the surf zone here appeared to be in heavier concentrations than observed earlier at Newport Beach. Calm seas and fair weather for most of the response period resulted in a rapid and successful cleanup.  All of the beaches were cleaned by March 2.  The FOSC concluded all cleanup operations by April 3.The 22,000 barrels of crude remaining in the damaged cargo tank were lightered by personnel from the USCG Pacific Strike Team and the responsible party using the USCG Air-Deliverable Anti-Pollution Transfer System (ADAPTS).  By 1200 on February 9, the oil from the damaged tank plus 90,000 barrels from the mid-body tanks had been transferred into barges to decrease the draft of the vessel.  Temporary patches were applied to the holes in the hull and the American Trader was moved to an oil transfer facility in Long Beach Harbor to off-load the remaining 470,000 barrels of crude oil.

Dimethoate is a sulfur-containing compound with a mercaptin-like odor.  Its high molecular weight and low vapor pressure makes it quite stable in solid form at ambient temperatures, and its odor is noticeable even in extremely low concentrations.  NOAA hypothesized that some vapor from the solid dimethoate may have leaked into the closed container during shipment, and that it was this vapor that was detected while the vessel was en route to San Francisco.  The concentration in the atmosphere within the container was probably never at a toxic level even though it would have been uncomfortable to breathe.  Once the container was opened and exposed to circulating air, the detectable odor would dissipate rapidly.    NOAA recommended that personnel involved in the inspection of the shipping container be suited in Level B protection as a conservative measure as dimethoate does not present a significant inhalation hazard when shipped in solid form.  The primary concern with this product was to avoid inhalation or ingestion of airborne dust from a potentially damaged shipping container and to restrict dermal contact to minimize any chance of skin absorption.  A visual inspection of the container by the Coast Guard Marine Safety Office found no evidence of damage to the container or spillage of dimethoate.  Accordingly, the container was left aboard the vessel for continuation to the WAARDRECHT's destination in Mexico.   The case was closed after the container was inspected and found to be undamaged.

The pilot and one crewman were recovered with serious burns.  One crewman remained missing and was presumed dead after an extensive search.  The explosion caused a relatively minor release of oil.  Flames from the initial and subsequent explosions shot as high as 1000 feet into the sky.  The fires on board the vessel were extinguished by late afternoon on November 1.Following the explosion, the USCG On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) ordered the vessel towed out of the vicinity of San Francisco Bay.  The intent of the order was to minimize the potential for catastrophic environmental effect from a massive release of oil.  On the basis of trajectory forecasts, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) recommended that the vessel be towed to the vicinity of a nearby ocean dumping site (37 32 N, 122 59 W).

The vessel was loaded with 22,000 barrels of Bunker C at the time of the incident.  The apparent cause was a still-air situation that developed between the mid-ship house and the afterdeck house.  Vapors emitting from the cargo tank vents created a vapor cloud during ballasting.  These were ignited in the midship house and flashed back through the vent piping system.  The largest explosion took place in the number 10 center cargo tank.  The force of the explosion propelled the main deck over the cargo tanks into the air.  When the deck landed, it severed a 36-inch cargo line on top of the inshore isolation valve.  This severed line fed fuel to the fire until response personnel discovered and capped it on December 21.  Nine lives were lost as a result of the explosion.  Debris and oil scattered in all directions.  Approximately 400 boats in the vicinity were damaged by the fine mist of airborne oil, resulting in millions of dollars in property damage.  An estimated 30,000 barrels of oil were released into Los Angeles harbor from the ship and the severed pipeline.A U.S. Coast Guard boat and a Los Angeles City Fire Department boat arrived on-scene within five minutes of the explosion to assist in firefighting and rescue operations.

Contributing factors to the incident were dense fog and darkness.Spill response started almost immediately.  A command post was established by 0445 by representatives from USCG District 12, the California Department of Fish and Game (CA DFG), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Although water borne movement of cleanup and containment equipment was hampered by the dense fog, containment booms were in place around both vessels by 0630.  The separation of the two vessels at 0900 resulted in an increased rate of spillage from theOregon Standard.  Concentrated efforts were directed at recovering oil still within the vessel's ruptured tanks.By the evening of January 18, Standard Oil had deployed numerous personnel and equipment along shoreline areas to recover the oil as it was beached.  By January 19, bird cleaning stations were established in several areas under the direction of CA DFG.Standard Oil was efficient in deploying cleanup resources well in advance of the oil movement due to good contingency planning.

A massive mixture of oil, gas, and drilling mud roared up the drill casing and spewed out onto the platform.  Well A-21 was capped on February 7 with 13,000 barrels of heavy drilling mud.  Oil continued to vent from natural faults several hundred yards from the platform, in tract 4042 between the coast and a chain of islands.  The faults released a total of 100,000 barrels of oil until December 1969.  A record-breaking storm immediately before the incident contributed to the large amount of oiled debris that needed to be collected as part of the spill response.  On February 2, the National Pollution Contingency Plan, instituted by President Johnson in 1968, went into effect for the first time.  The Federal Water Pollution Control Administration was on-scene to monitor the well-killing process and cleanup.  Red Adair was brought in to provide expertise capping the well.  To aid in predicting the slick movement, the National Weather Service set up a local station to monitor winds and tides.  Weather during the cleanup was moderate except for a storm on February 4 and 5 that temporarily halted cleanup by damaging booms that were protecting harbors and marinas.  The majority of the cleanup was completed within 45 days.  Commercial fishing was completely closed in the area from February until April.  Although the environmental effects of the spill were relatively minimal, economic effects were extensive due to loss of fishing income, loss of recreational facilities, and damage to personal property.

The vessel was old and the oceanic crossing was scheduled to be her final journey.  After delivery of her cargo, the ship was destined for destruction as scrap.  Shortly following departure, a welded seam ruptured between two steel plates on the starboard side, well above the water line.  The U.S. harbor authorities refused permission to return to Los Angeles.  The vessel then proceeded to Ensenada Harbor in Baja California to have the ruptured seam repaired by welding.  Authorities in Ensenada refused permission to have the repair work done within the Harbor so welders were taken aboard and the ship proceeded offshore an estimated 60 miles to have the welding accomplished.  At this distance offshore, the vessel may have been situated within the influence of the southward-flowing California Current System. Welding repairs were completed successfully.  Unfortunately, a dense fog settled throughout the region.  A single sun sight was made within the two days offshore, to establish the ship's position.  On this basis, a return to Ensenada was undertaken to offload the welders.  In the early morning hours of March 29 1957, the vessel struck the coast at a location about 64 km south of Ensenada Harbor.  The bow grounded against one side of the entrance to a small cove on a predominantly rocky shore.  The stern apparently swung around and stuck on a shallow spot midway across the cove (henceforth Tampico cove) entrance.  The hull thus served as a breakwater across about 2/3 of the cove entrance, creating fairly calm conditions landward of the hull.  The crew and passengers were able to disembark and reach shore safely in the lee of the hull.  A portion of the oil cargo was liberated at the time of grounding.  The remainder escaped over the next 6-9 months as the ship was slowly torn asunder by pounding surf.   The location was in a remote section of coastline so no countermeasures were taken to remove a portion of the cargo or lessen ensuing pollution of the shore.  A few shacks scattered along the coast here housed native fishermen and their families.  The site was accessible by an extremely rough road, best negotiated by 4-wheel drive vehicles.  The main paved highway ran about 10-20 miles inland and the trip from there  to the study site required 2-3 hours.  Keyword: accidental grounding, diesel oil, mixing by surf."

Also discussed were response options, including releasing the oil from the containment boom, the use of firefighting foam to inhibit any potential explosive hazard, and the use of fire hoses to spray along the shoreline to keep the gasoline away and to break up the slick. The New Have Fire Department was on scene and acting as the Incident Commander. They did not have any way to apply foam to the spill. The boom was opened about 0800 on an ebb tide."

The source, the amount and the product were (and remain) unconfirmed.  However, it is suspected that the release happened sometime on the night of Sunday January 08 and was a diesel or #2 heating oil product (chemical analysis through the  USCG Marine Safety Lab is pending) and the amount is somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 gallons. Helped by slow currents and consistent west to southwest winds, a large portion of the released product pooled at the northern end of the Island End River (IER) and recovery operations have been focused there.  Some oil sheen was reported in the Mystic River (upper end of Boston Harbor) and in the Chelsea River, about a half a mile east of the IER, but none of it was deemed recoverable.  Protective booming of the salt marshes at the end of the Chelsea River (aka: ""Chelsea Creek"") was deployed as an extra safety measure. The Island End River is more of an inlet than a true river.  Historically (a century ago) it flowed through Chelsea and Everett to the sea.  Today it terminate approximately a quarter mile from the Mystic River (generally considered part of Boston Harbor), is about 200 yards wide and heavily industrialized on one side.  The other side has a small park and condominium project known as Admiral Hill.  Environmentally the area is of note due to historic (and heavy) contamination from coal tar.  The bottom sediments as well as much of the southeastern shoreline are contaminated by chronic (now secured) and acute releases of the materials.  The exposed coal tar on the shoreline dates back to the 1940s.  The material is a byproduct of a large coal gasification facility that operated from the turn of the 19th century to sometime in the early 1960s.   Response Activities: The USCG has been supervising the oil spill cleanup contractor as it uses vacuum trucks and sorbents to recover trapped materials.  Over 3,000 gallons (oil) have been recovered thus far.  NOAA Activities: The NOAA SSC has been working with the FOSC and SOSC on cleanup options and spill characterization, including work with the NOAA HAZMAT modeling staff on oil fate calculations, and reverse trajectories."

Given the forecast on an approaching winter frontal passage and the distance off-shore (25 plus miles), no landfall of oil was forecast for the next several days.  Any diesel fuel released would not persist more than a couple of miles from the release point due to the chemical nature of diesel oil and relative high seas (4-5').  The SSC also consulted with the Texas State SSC relative to trajectory implications.  	At approximately 2100 hrs, the USCG called to update the situation:  The lift boat did explode.  The cause of the explosion is still under investigation.  Six people were injured (broken bones and burns), but at this point, no fatalities.  The sub-sea safety valve was shut preventing any release from the well, and the well was reported to only be producing water at the time of the explosion.  This is still preliminary information, but the USCG was confident that there was no apparent well release based on confirming observations from a USCG vessel on-scene.

The four barges had broken loose from the towboat and three were fully involved in fire.  An unknown amount of gasoline was leaking into the river.  Barges are lashed together and are located at mile 14.5.  Total product onboard the four barges was 70,000 bbl (2,940,000 gallons) of gasoline.  NOAA was asked to provided scientific support relative to possible fate scenarios and resources at risk.  The river was at normal-to-low water levels, and well within its banks.  Therefore, the resources of greatest risk are those in the river itself.  Gasoline is expected to completely evaporate, so the risk to aquatic resources is from acute toxicity from exposure to the highly soluble toxic fractions and near the source.  Transport down river was not expected to be uniform.  Gasoline could collect in eddies and oxbows, and present a potential for downstream localized hazards.  In these collection areas, the gasoline could also absorb to available organic material.  In addition, a local toxic shock to biota in shallow nearby areas was possible.  Pallid sturgeon (a listed endangered species) were present in the river, but were predicted to be concentrate at the control structure (upstream of the release site and not at significant risk).  Other rare species thought present in the river at the time of the incident were paddlefish and blue suckers.  These fish are highly mobile able to avoid exposures that would result in death.  Exceptions might be to juvenile fish in shallow areas close to the shoreline.  The greatest risk was to the commercial fishery.  An estimated 25-30 commercial fishermen worked the stretch threatened.  Commercial fisheries at risk included buffalo, freshwater drum, and several species of catfish.  Other resources present in the area included eagles and wading bird colonies.  For two days the barges were allowed to burn.  When the fire significant subsided, fire suppression experts attached the fire with water and foam.  The barges were then allowed to cool and possible reignition minimized by a foam blanket.  All barges were lightered and moved off scene by the evening of 28 February.  Only a ""negligible amount"" of gasoline was thought lost downstream.  USCG district 8."

The cause of the release is still under investigation.  Between 850 and 1200 bbls of a deep well production oil was released.  The oil was identified as MARS Blend, a relatively high sulfur, low asphaltene crude oil.  The initial trajectory predicted the oil would move south of Four Bayous pass and sustained north winds would move most of the oil offshore.  The winds were less than the forecast and the spill coincided with a spring tide (not the season Spring, but the description of the time in the tide cycle characterized by the greatest high and low tides, derived from spring up or rise).  Much of the oil moved back into Four Bayous and Barataria Pass.  The next morning.  Heavy concentrations of oil were observed on shorelines and on water.  The NOAA SSC participated in a morning overflight (pre-SCAT survey) on Thanksgiving morning to delineate oiled shorelines and surface oil.  Heavy surface oil concentrations north of Grand Terre and south of Four Bayous Pass were identified and skimmers repositioned.  Heavy oil was observed on the barrier islands of Barataria Bay.  The barrier islands impacted were Elmer's Island, Grand Isle, Grand Terre, and East Grand Terre.  The latter two were the heaviest impacted and the most remote (no road access).  Stranded oil was heaviest near the passes and on the eastern end of each island.  At least one marina at Grand Isle was impacted.	By Friday (two days after the spill), overflights looked encouraging.  Very little oil was visually observed on the beaches and on-water sheens were significantly reduced; unfortunately, most of the oil was buried by depositional sand and the lower tide level was preventing remobilization of stranded oil.  	The SCAT team used the aerial pre-SCAT survey to aid shoreline assessments since the heavily oiled beach areas were previously identified, but now mostly hidden by over-laying sand.  SCAT was an essential element in the response and used by the Unified Command to define areas which required cleanup as well as monitoring cleanup activities to insure that the cleanup recommendations were both adequate and adhered to by field crews.  More than 100 cleanup works were engaged in this response.  Cleanup objectives and endpoints were developed within the SCAT organization.  SCAT recommendations developed a balance between preserving beach sand (a valued state resource) and minimizing potential environmental threats.  		At the end of the day (Sunday, 28 Nov.), only five sites are still being cleaned.  Of particular interest are a small marsh on the interior of East Grand Terre and a Gobi revetment (riprap) along the Conoco facility on the north side of Grand Isle (see Hotline #15 pictures, EGT and GIC, respectively).  Both sites contain free oil.  Both sites present unique cleanup problems.  The interior marsh is highly isolated and composed of very soft sediments which restrict access without causing environmental injury.

The amount released was unknown.  Subsequent USCG overflights observed no visible sheens associated with the fishing vessel.  Since no sheens were observed, there was reason to suspect that a majority of the diesel fuel was still on-board.  The USCG considered the sunken vessel a hazard to both navigation and the environment.  While diesel is generally considered a nonpersistant oil with a relatively high evaporation rate and natural dispersion rate, most diesel fuel oils are, at the same time, highly toxic.  The NOAA SSC was asked to provide information to assess potential spill trajectories and possible environmental affects related to the sunken fishing boat.  NOAA also provided an evaluation of potential damages under possible spill scenarios using the Type A Model.  This information was used to develop both a response strategy and a cost-benefit analysis related to salvage operations and cost.  Using the information provided by NOAA, the MSO was able to develop and negotiate a cost effective salvage plan.  The diesel fuel was pumped off the vessel eliminating the environmental hazard.

The spilled oil was a condensate crude with an API of 38.  The stretch of shoreline from Galveston to Freeport is historically an area with high concentrations of birds.  In particular, the area around San Luis Pass is an important feeding and loafing area for shorebirds, gulls, terns, loons, pelicans, and wading birds.  At the time of the spill, because of the very early spring weather, many birds were staging along the beaches, particularly shorebirds who are feeding to bulk up for the migration to nesting areas.  Though shorebirds have a lower tendency to get oiled (compared to diving birds who spend much of their time on the water surface or diving for prey) they spend a lot of time feeding at the water/land interface where any tarballs that come ashore are likely to concentrate.  With onshore winds, the ultimate fate of any persistent oil was shoreline stranding.  Normally, tarballs on shore are not an issue because they are easy to clean up.  However, because of the high concentrations of birds present in the area of the predicted impact, there was a risk of birds getting oiled.  USCG district 8.  Keyword: boom, Corexit 9500."

At the time of the sinking the weather was harsh with heavy seas and winds over 15 knots. -  - Upon sinking, a USCG overflight observed a broken sheen extending northwesterly for approximately one mile at approximately 500 yards wide. -  - The NOAA SSC was notified of the spill directly by the MSO Boston.  After consulting with the weather service, SHIO and ADIOS, it was determined that land impacts of any significant amount were unlikely.  In addition, it was agreed that any attempt at protection strategies would prove pointless, given the heavy surf.  The FOSC considered sending divers to close the vents.  It was agreed that, if the vessel was in 200+ feet of water, such an operation would be unnecessarily risky to the divers. -  - On the morning (11/3/97) overflight, no sheen was sighted.  The vessel's owner had determined the depth of the vessel at 140 feet and had decided to send hard-hat divers to begin salvage operations.While the divers are on-station, they will close the vents to prevent any further release.  The diving operation will begin Tuesday (11/4/97), weather permitting.  USCG will monitor for oil releases at that time. -  - The vessel sank less than one mile north of the Stellwagon Bank National Marine Sanctuary and some twelve miles east of the Plum Island USFWS Reserve.

The tug Scandia was abandoned and USCG Search and Rescue teams were dispatched to assist the crew.  At approximately 2000 EST, a USCG helicopter reported that the barge North Cape was aground on Nebraska Shoals, directly adjacent to the Trustom Pond National Wildlife Refuge, owned and operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).  The helicopter further reported that the barge was releasing oil.  The barge North Cape spilled oil in two separate releases.  The first, released during the height of the initial storm, was 700,000 gallons and the second, less than a day later, was 125,000 gallons.  The combination of the type of oil released and the energy of the storm caused great dispersion into the water column.  As a result, in the days following the spill, great numbers of shellfish (mostly bivalves and juvenile lobsters) washed  ashore.  Subsequently, the Rhode Island Department of Health closed more than 200 square miles of commercial fishery in the area of the spill.  This closure was coordinated with the EPA Region One and with NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), which closed federal fishing grounds using the Magnuson Act.  This is the first time federal fisheries have been closed due to oil contamination.  The emergency phase of the response lasted seven days and the on-scene command post was demobilized following the removal of the barge North Cape from the beach.

This collision caused three separate emergencies:  1) the Balsa 37,  which was carrying a cargo of phosphate rock, was severely damaged on the starboard side, was listing at an increasing rate, and was in danger of capsizing in the channel; 2) the Ocean 255, which was loaded with jet fuel, gasoline, and a small amount of diesel fuel was burning out of control just south of Mullet Key; and 3) the Bouchard 155  was holed at the port bow spilling approximately 8,000 barrels of #6 fuel oil into Tampa Bay.Stabilizing the vessels was the first priority of responders.  By 2200 the Ocean 255 barge fire was extinguished and the GST was conducting cooling procedures and maintaining a fire watch.  Lightering operations were well underway on the Bouchard 155 barge in preparation for moving it to dockage in the Port of Tampa where it would be cleaned before dry docking.  The Balsa 37 was intentionally grounded outside the shipping channel to prevent it from capsizing and to open the channel for traffic while repairs and stability evaluations were conducted.August 10 overflight observations showed a three- to six-meter wide band of oil along the beaches.  By the next day, this band appeared to be about half its original width.  Systematic shoreline surveys were conducted and oil was found buried by two to eight inches of clean sand deposited during high tide.  Cleanup crews focused on manually removing the band of surface oil high on the beach.  A plan was developed to remove the subsurface oil without generating large volumes of sediment for handling, disposal, and replacement.  The plan called for mechanical removal of the heavy buried layers, manual removal of moderately oiled sediments, and mechanically pushing stained sand onto the lower part of the beach for surf washing.  Pompoms were strung along the surf zone to collect any oil refloated during the surf washing.By August 11 the status of the vessels had improved substantially.  The response focus began to change from  emergency issues to skimming operations, protection strategies, forecasts, and planning.Meanwhile, cleanup crews were contending with very thick oil that had been deposited around some mangrove islands.  Tarmats formed when sediment was mixed with oil along the shallow flats surrounding the islands.  Large thick mats coated mangrove roots, oyster and seagrass beds, and tidal mud flats.  Most of this oil was vacuumed out using vacuum transfer units on grounded barges staged around the islands and shallow areas.  Seawalls within the bay were being washed using high-pressure water heated to 110 degrees.The GST was onscene throughout the spill response.  They provided support with the Vessel of Opportunity Skimming System as well as the fire fighting, monitoring, and lightering of the Ocean 255 barge.Roughly 14.5 miles of fine-grained sand beach from St. Petersburg Beach north to Redington Shores Beach were affected by this spill.  Sand beaches on Egmont Key at the entrance to Tampa Bay were also oiled.  Additionally, four mangrove islands inside the entrance to Boca Ciega Bay at Johns Pass and two small areas of Spartina marsh were oiled.  Jetties, seawalls, and riprap within the bay and at Johns Pass and Blind Pass were also oiled to varying degrees.  It is estimated that over 30 miles of residential seawalls were oiled within Boca Ciega Bay.  Some impact also occurred on the northern side of Mullet Key at Bonne Fortune Key in fringing mangroves.Seawalls, jetties, walkways, and riprap were cleaned by high-pressure hot-water washes.  PES-51 was considered for some of these cleaning needs, but after observing comparison tests performed by the manufacturer, the RP decided against its use.Cleanup of submerged tarmats offshore is ongoing.  NOAA is working with the  RRT, the GST, the Army Corps of Engineers, the FOSC, State officials, and various scientists and engineers to develop a sound method for dealing with the tarmats.  Additional on-scene participation by NOAA is anticipated.  USCG district 7.  Keyword: sorbent pompoms, high-pressure warm-water washes, sorbent boom."

The lateness of the report was probably caused by reduced visibility because of early-morning fog that restricted the ability of aircraft to spot the spill.  MSO Morgan City reported that CONOCO personnel reported at 1600 that the spill was caused by a break in a CONOCO pipeline and estimated the amount of product spilled at five gallons.  In actuality, the spill, based on initial overflight reports, was probably 300 to 600 gallons.CONOCO brought in CONOCO response personnel, Clean Gulf, Riedel Peterson, and Petroleum Helicopter, Inc.

All three cargo tanks of the Apex 3417 were damaged, as well as the aft tank of the Apex 3503, resulting in the release of nearly 17,000 barrels of  No. 5 oil (vacuum oil/catalytic feed stock) into Galveston Bay.  A third tank barge also under tow, the Apex 3510, was not damaged in the collision. The Apex 3417 sank with its stern resting on the bottom of the channel and only its bow showing above the water.  It released nearly all of its cargo, over 15,000 barrels of oil, over the course of two days.  Apex 3503 was less damaged and ultimately released 1130 barrels of oil into the water.  The Apex 3510 was towed to Houston, discharged its 23,000 barrel cargo, and returned on July 30 to offload the remaining oil from the Apex 3503. The USCG Marine Safety Office (MSO) Galveston closed the Houston Ship Channel to marine traffic from two miles north to two miles south of the incident site (between buoys 51 and 60).  Apex Towing Co., Inc. immediately accepted responsibility for the spill.  Apex hired Riedel-Peterson Environmental Services to contain the oil at the site of the barges, and T & T Marine Salvage to raise and remove the Apex 3417 barge from the channel.  On July 29, Malin Environmental was hired for additional cleanup assistance, and the Clean Gulf Association provided skimmers for use by Apex.  In a meeting with the USCG On-Scene Coordinator (OSC), Apex was criticized for allowing the cleanup contractors to operate without direct supervision.  At the suggestion of the OSC, Apex hired O'Brien Oil Pollution Services to oversee the cleanup operations as well as Garner Environmental Services and Industrial Cleanup, Inc. for addition cleanup support.On July 30, the cargo of theApex 3503 was lightered to the Apex 3510  which was then taken to Houston for offloading.  On July 31, the HSC was opened to inbound single-width barge tows only, under positive control of the Vessel Traffic Service, and with assistance from at least one tug when proceeding past the accident site.  These traffic restrictions remained in effect until August 3.  Following the movement of Apex 3417 from the middle of the channel on August 3, the HSC was restricted to one-way traffic only, with direction of travel being reversed every 8 to 12 hours.  After cleaning, gas freeing, and welding repairs, Apex 3417 was towed to Galveston.  The HSC was opened to all ship traffic without restriction on August 10.  Cleanup operations continued until the case was closed on August 17, 1990.  USCG district 8.

The barge was loaded with 20,000 barrels of Number 6 Fuel Oil.  Fifteen minutes later, the E-24 was standing almost vertically with about 20 feet of the barge visible above the surface of the water.  At the time of the incident, there was heavy rain, 5-6 foot seas, and winds from the east at 25 knots.  The incident took place in an area known as ""The Race"", the passage between the Long Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean, which typically has severe rip tides and rough, unpredictable seas.  On November 23 at 2250 the barge sank in a keel-up position in 185 feet of water.  Approximately 15-24 barrels of Number 6 fuel oil was forced from compartment vents, and as much as 47 barrels of diesel fuel was lost from the pump room. The cargo compartments were not damaged during the sinking.Oil from the barge formed a slick measuring 0.5 miles long by 500 yards wide as observed on November 23.  Cleanup of the Long Island shoreline began on November 24 and was completed by December 5. Approximately 1000 gallons of oily debris were recovered.  Later releases of oil occurred during the salvage operations, but skimming equipment was on station and recovered most of that lost oil immediately.  An estimated 225 birds were affected by the spill, with 75 of these recovered dead.Salvage of the barge without damaging the intact cargo compartments was the major concern.  Due to heavy seas and limitations of equipment on scene, the exact position of the barge could not be determined and verified until December 19.  On January 3, 1986, the USCG On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) federalized the case as the responsible party, Eklof Transportation Co., Inc. was unable to meet the deadlines imposed by the OSC for performing the hull survey and inspection.Evaluation, planning, and mobilization for the salvage operations took place from January 3 to May 4, 1986.  The salvage plan was developed by the United States Navy Supervisor of Salvage (NAVSUPSALV) at the request of the OSC.  The OSC staff report was completed on March 3, and detailed three salvage options determined by the NAVSUPSALV.  After much deliberation, the OSC determined that the barge should be raised with its cargo intact.  Salvage operations took place from May 5 to May 30, 1986.  Approximately 235 gallons of oil were lost during the entire operation, of which 185 were recovered. The barge was inspected and in tow by the evening of May 29, and was moored at Mariners Harbor, Staten Island, New York by 1900, May 30.  The E-24 was completely offloaded by June 11, 1986, and the case was closed.  USCG district 1.

The vessel suffered a structural failure which ruptured the hull near the No. 2 tanks.  The resulting spill of approximately 65,500 barrels of Venezuelan Merey and Pilon crude oil was carried in a westerly direction by wind and currents.  Offshore recovery was hampered by rough weather and the magnitude of the spill.  The water temperature was 80?F and winds were from the east and northeast 15-20 knots.The spill moved slowly westward, coming ashore near High Island, along the Bolivar Peninsula, and into Galveston Bay, Texas between Aug. 2-5.  Oil impacts were severe at Rollover Inlet and Crystal Beach, and on Aug. 4 more oil was pushed ashore further south along the Galveston Island coast.  The spill affected 90% of Galveston's West Beach, including 80% of the Galveston seawall and the associated rock groins and pilings.  Oil in the seawall area was a concern due to the oils smothering effect on marine organisms.  Organisms in this area were determined to be a minor part of the entire ecosystem and due to their transient nature were able to move to more suitable habitats.  Several dead crabs, rays, and fish were recovered along the seawall but could not be directly attributed to the spill.  Also oiled were marsh grass areas in East Bay (10-20 barrels) and 2 small lagoons.  Some oil which entered Galveston Channel did affect several small sand islands used as nesting sites for birds, although no affected birds or eggs were reported.

The oil spread to East Bay, Tampa Bay and Hillsborough Bay and impacted 15 widely separated shorelines over a distance of approximately 20 miles.Personnel aboard the Howard Star failed to notify authorities of the discharge.  The  Coast Guard Marine Safety Office (MSO) Tampa was first notified by IMC on October 4 at 2025 that approximately 15 gallons of oil was in the water at the IMC terminal.  The Coast Guard discovered large quantities of floating oil streaming into Hillsborough Bay from the Port Sutton Canal.  The Environmental Coastal Pollution Cleanup Service (ECPCS) was notified of the spill and began mobilizing all available boom and cleanup equipment on October 5.  An additional cleanup contractor, Need-A-Diver, was contracted by the Coast Guard.  The Regional Response Team (RRT) was activated at 1115 on October 5, and the USCG Gulf Strike Team was requested.  Because the entire transit system was affected, the port was closed to help contain the oil.  The MSO and cleanup contractors deployed four sections of boom to prevent the oil from spreading further into the surrounding bays.  By October 9, approximately 643 barrels of oil had been recovered by the contractors and the Coast Guard.  Since the populations of migratory waterfowl are low in October, there were only 14 known bird fatalities.  Several dead crabs were found along Whiskey Key and E.G.

An underwater survey of the barge on February 4 reported no oil leaking from the barge, however, oil patches and light sheen were reported in the surrounding area on February 5.  After the STC-101  was refloated on February 6 by the McLean Construction Company, the barge was intentionally grounded in Ingram Bay for dewatering operations.  Extensive damage to the port side was discovered.  Severe wind and weather conditions as well as poorly maintained and improperly secured cargo hatches may have contributed to the oil spillage.After the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Office Hampton Roads received several reports of oil and birds washing up on surrounding shorelines, a Federal spill was declared on February 8.  On February 19, the AMOCO Terminal in Baltimore, Maryland, concluded that 5,959 barrels of oil were missing from the STC-101  barge.Beach and marsh areas of both the eastern and western shores of Chesapeake Bay were contaminated.

Later estimates reported 10,000 barrels of pollutant spilled into the water.  Part of the spilled amount was released in the collision while the remainder leaked from the damaged tanks over the next several days.  Weather conditions at the time of the accident were extremely adverse.  Extensive fog, winds of 30-35 knots with 40 knot gusts, and seas of 3-4 feet hampered early containment attempts.  Since the owner and operator of the damaged barge denied any responsibility in cleaning up the oil, U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) personnel began cleanup operations using the Oil Spill Contingency Fund.  Brine Service Company was the primary cleanup contractor from March 12 until March 18 when Clean Channel Industries became the principal contractor, focusing on beach cleanup.  After March 12, the USCG took on a strictly supervisory and monitoring role while contract personnel performed the actual cleanup.Two days after the spill, the local Audubon Society, with USCG assistance, collected and cleaned approximately 400 oil soaked Eared Grebes.  The 320 surviving birds were released in an unpolluted area selected by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.  The Texas Department of Health, EPA Region 6, and Texas A&M University conducted ecological and pollutant studies in the affected area.  Preliminary results showed little long-term adverse effect to the environment.  Active cleanup continued until April 6 when the case officially closed, however cleaning on Atkinson and Bulkhead Reef Islands to the east of the Houston Ship Channel continued until the week of April 9.

Platform 26 exploded and caught fire.  The platform included 22 production wells with a capacity of 15,000 barrels of crude oil per day.  The flames from the burning platform blazed 400 feet into the air.  The 21-B well, with a 424-barrel per day capacity, ruptured 12 feet above the water.  By December 3, the service crane had collapsed towards the center of the platform at a 60? angle.  Burning oil covered the surface of the water within 50 feet of the platform.  By December 7, well No. 21-B was contributing to 30-50 percent of the fire.  Shifting winds, fog and rough seas slowed response efforts at times.Holes were shot into the tubing of some of the wells to determine whether oil was still being produced.  On January 12, Shell Oil Co. personnel perforated a relief well in an attempt to contain the flow.  On January 20, eight of the wells remained on fire.  Corexit 7664 dispersant was applied to the slick at a rate of 3 barrels per hour.Response operations began moderating on March 1.  A U.S. Coast Guard cutter and helicopter were released from the scene.  Shell Oil Co. officials were required to submit daily pollution reports to the U.S. Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP), New Orleans, in advance of any operations that may have increased pollution.  Drilling, capping, and pumping of the wells continued throughout April.  By April 16, the estimated rate of release was 20 barrels per day.  The slick was reportedly staying within a 6-mile radius of the platform, with sheen extending to 12 miles.  The slick was reduced to sheen during the following months as pumping and capping operations continued.Beach surveys were conducted by personnel from the U.S. Coast Guard, Shell Oil Co., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries, and other local observers.  The only shoreline oiling that resulted from the incident was  between Caminada Pass and Bay Champagne.  The case was closed by the U.S. Coast Guard on May 17, 1971.  The explosion and subsequent fire killed four people and seriously burned 37 others.  USCG district 8.  "

A long oil slick was noted on the surface, and it was believed that this was just the fuel emanating from the vents and that the two fuel tanks were intact.   Trying to beat some forecast heavy winds for the night of August 19, the owner immediately hired divers to plug the vents.  In so doing the divers noted that the starboard tank was empty of an estimated 200 gallons of diesel.   The next day, when the strong winds never materialized, divers again descended to the vessel to attempt to pump out the port fuel tank, but found it empty also.   Apparently all the fuel  had escaped the first day and been rapidly dispersed by the strong tidal currents, and there was probably less than 500 gallons of diesel on the vessel when in sank.

NOAA's initial report to the USCG was that the trajectory of the logs will continue west-southwest at 2% of the wind speed (0.5 knots) until they cross the 100-fathom curve where they will encounter the Alaska Current and begin moving in a west-northwest direction at approximately the same speed.Due to the severe weather, many of the log bundles broke apart making it very difficult for ships' radar to see this debris.  The weather was not cooperative and overflights could be conducted only every 3 to 5 days.  As location reports came in, they were forwarded to NOAA in Seattle who then used this information to provide a search location for the next overflight.  The Alaska Stream occupies this portion of the GOA and moves from east to west and the logs were gradually dispersed and carried west-northwest toward the central GOA.

The most likely scenario would be a small, continuous leak from the tank's vent pipes.  However, a catastrophic release of the entire fuel tank could occur any time during or after the sinking of the vessel.  Since the vessel was subject to the Tongass Narrows currents,  the visible extent of the slick and sheen could range from a few meters in length to a few thousand meters, respectively.      NOAA suggested that the Coast Guard check the water depth at the pier because a partial sinking could result in a tidally induced pumping action which would cause a much greater rate of outflow of diesel fuel.    Consultation with resource agencies revealed large populations of herring and chinook salmon, and thousands of seabirds, including 50 bald eagles, in the vessel's immediate vicinity.  Any of these animals could be affected by a release.  USCG district 17."

Berman went aground in the surf zone off Escambron Beach in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The barge grounded on a hard bottom consisting of rocky substrate with scattered coral after its towing cable parted.The barge had a capacity of three million gallons but was reportedly only half full.  The cargo, a heavy #6 fuel oil, began spilling and impacted nearby shoreline and shallow intertidal habitats immediately.  No estimated leakage rate was available.  Due to strong northerly winds, the surf at the grounding site was quite strong creating a hazardous situation as they pounded the deck of the vessel. The responsible party initially assumed responsibility for the spill, but very quickly expended the ten million dollar limit of their insurance policy.  Full federal funding of the spill occurred at 0600 on January 14 and it became a United States Coast Guard (USCG) directed response.The USCG Gulf Strike Team (GST) was brought onscene and immediately began lightering operations for the barge.  Skimming and lightering operations were effective and removed an estimated 17,700 barrels of oil from the water and leaking barge.  Shoreline cleanup and assessment began almost immediately.  Little progress was made however due to continued leaking of fresh oil from the barge.  Cleaned areas became re-oiled and areas not yet cleaned became more heavily impacted.  Protection strategies were employed for areas at risk that were not yet oiled.  Intensive shoreline cleanup was postponed for the most heavily impacted areas until the sources of re-oiling could be stopped.  Two shallow lagoons near the grounding site were most heavily impacted.  Oil, in the form of large mats, accumulated on the surface and on the bottom of the lagoons.  Submerged oil posed a major cleanup problem during the response.  It was eventually partially removed by divers, vacuum transfer units, and a dredge.  Waste and oily water from dredging operations were collected and separated in a series of swimming pools arranged to decant and filter the effluent from the dredge before returning the filtered water to the sea. On January 15, the barge was refloated, towed to a scuttling site 20 miles northeast of San Juan, and sunk.  This operation was carefully reviewed by the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC), Navy Superintendent of Salvage (SUPSALV), the GST, and NOAA.  The Regional Response Team (RRT) was consulted and on-scene trustee representatives were given an opportunity to discuss the operation and voice their concerns.  It was agreed by all that the sinking of the barge was the best alternative.  Continued re-oiling of the nearshore environment from the unrecoverable oil left onboard was delaying cleanup and preventing resource recovery.  Resource concerns offshore were minimal and it was hoped that the amount of residual oil left on the barge when it sank would be small and have little impact.  Shorelines at risk from any oil released during the scuttling operations were predicted to be on northwestern Puerto Rico, Mona Island, and Hispaniola.Shoreline cleaning continued in earnest and was more successful with the barge removed.  Surface and buried oil along sand beaches was removed following cleanup guidelines.  Beachrock, riprap, and seawalls were cleaned with pressure washing and chemical cleaners as approved.  Some inaccessible areas were left to clean naturally.  Cleanup guidelines for oiled historical structures were developed and approved by trustees through the Heritage Resource Team.  These structures and resources were then cleaned according to those guidelines.On February 3, oil impacts along northwestern Puerto Rico were reported.  A convergence zone at the northwest corner of the island concentrated debris and oil still being released from the scuttled barge.  Impacts were primarily along 12 miles of shoreline, from Isabella to Borinquen.  This oil was buried as oily sand layers and submerged as oil and sand mats in the protected areas or crenulate bays.  A separate command post was established on the west end of the island and assessments and cleanup operations began immediately.  Crews removed the stranded oil quickly to prevent additional burial.  Cleanup efforts were intensified in this area to minimize risks to nesting sea turtles, whose arrival was imminent. All necessary cleanup guidelines and inspection criteria were in place by mid-February.  With the exception of nearshore reef fish and benthic organisms near the barge's grounding site, there were very few impacts to biological resources.   Seagrasses were oiled near the grounding site.  Very few birds were affected and no substantiated reports of spill related mortalities to reptiles or mammals were received.  The impacted shoreline was divided into 18 shoreline segments or zones.  Most of these zones were cleaned and inspected following the ""how clean is clean"" guidelines, and approved by the FOSC by April 4.  All other zones were signed off by April 25, with the exception of zone 18, which was completed on May 27.  Once approved as clean, each zone entered a monitoring and maintenance phase to address any additional oiling that may occur.  USCG district 7.  Keyword: endangered species, bioremediation."

NOAA reported that the shoreline is mostly sand beaches, gravel beaches, mixed sand and gravel beaches, and rocky shores or seawalls.  The offshore islands that are surrounded by mangroves would not be affected if the winds continued to be easterly.  NOAA estimated that the slick would tend to the west or northwest and would come ashore on beaches inshore and to the west of the facility.  This could have occurred for a considerable distance, depending on the weather conditions and local small-scale oceanographic circulation patterns.  There was a small chance that, with a large enough quantity of free-floating, unrestricted oil and continued easterly winds, the oil might round Punta Guayanilla and impact the beaches of Punta Verraco and Bahia de Guayanilla.  If this did happen, NOAA advised that the large mangrove forests of Bahia de Guayanilla be protected.  NOAA further advised that the oil would persist in the environment, with a small quantity evaporating during weathering.  Reef impacts would be low because the oil is not very soluble; there would probably be no impacts at all below the surface, although there could be severe shoreline impacts.   In addition, NOAA reported that the oil would strand at the high tide line and persist or wash away, depending on sand and gravel transport on that beach.  Finally, sticky, weathered bunker oil would adhere to rocky shores and mangroves, killing the mangroves when the oil got into the root system. Turtles currently nesting in Puerto Rico and along the sandy beaches of Punta Verraco were at risk.  Oiled adults would suffer irritated mucous membranes and would develop lesions that would probably result in an increased risk of infection.  Oiled hatchlings would probably die, whether they were on the beach or floating offshore.  Oiled turtle eggs and newly hatched turtles had a greater than 80% chance of mortality.  There were many species of birds present, including the brown pelican, a federally listed endangered species.  If oiled feathers remained untreated, the birds would die as a result of loss of insulation or ingestion of oil during preening.  The diving birds (brown pelican, brown booby, terns), wading birds  (herons and egrets), shorebirds (plovers, sandpipers), and ducks were the most likely to be affected because they would dive and wade into the oil slick.  Seabirds (magnificent frigate bird) and gulls skim the surface when feeding and would also be affected.  Large numbers of gulls would also be impacted.  USCG district 7."

On February 10, 1983, a tanker collided with a platform.  The platform developed a 45-degree tilt and had to be shut down.  Wave action and corrosion apparently caused the riser to collapse into the wellhead causing a spill of approximately 1,500 barrels per day.  The well was not capped because the field was in the middle of the Iran/Iraq war zone. This platform was attacked by Iraqi planes in March and the resulting slick caught fire.  This well was capped by the Iranians on September 18, 1983.  Eleven people were killed during the operation.In March 1983, a nearby platform was attacked with rockets by Iraqi helicopters.  The platform burned and spilled oil at an initial rate of approximately 5,000 barrels per day.  The rate slowed to about 1,500 barrels per day in the two years before the well was capped.  In May 1985, the fire was extinguished and the well was plugged with the assistance of divers.  Nine men died during these operations.  Approximately 733,000 barrels of oil spilled into the sea as a result of this incident.  It is estimated that the rate of oil leaking into the Persian Gulf in mid-May of 1983 was between 4,000 and 10,000 barrels per day due to more war-related activity or the collapse of burning platforms.  As a result of this incident, a cooperative program for large-scale trajectory modeling was developed between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Kuwait's Environment Protection Council under the Ministry of Public Health.

The master and seven crew members died as a result of the accident.  Approximately 98,955 barrels of oil spilled into the sea as a result of the breakup.  The bow section, which still contained 36,650 barrels of oil, sank in 300 feet of water.  Substantial amounts of oil continued to leak from the sunken bow until several small leaks in the bow were sealed in May.  The stern remained afloat and was towed to the port of Le Havre where its remaining 54,975 barrels of oil were offloaded.Strong northwest winds at the time of the incident moved the oil towards the Breton coast.  Due to the high viscosity of the oil and severe weather conditions, containment or dispersal at sea was impossible.  Because the spring tides in this region have an average tidal range of 26 feet, many areas along the coast could not be boomed effectively.  Consequently, the Breton coast (which had already received major oil impacts from the Torrey Canyon  spill in 1967 and the Amoco Cadiz  in 1978), was again severely oiled.  Approximately 45 percent of the Amoco Cadiz  spill area was affected by oil from the Tanio.  Approximately 125 miles of the coastline of the two Departments of Finistere and Cotes-du-Nord were oiled.Both Departments implemented the Plan Polmar, the French national oil spill contingency plan, due to the severity of the coastal oiling.  This enabled them to use the national army for cleanup operations.  Personnel from the Civil Defense organization, fire service, local governments, commercial contractors, and local farmers were also involved in the cleanup.  The International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation (ITOPF) provided technical advice and monitored cleanup activities on behalf of the International Oil Pollution Compensation (IOPC) Fund.  Cleanup operations in the two Departments varied due to differences in the severity of the pollution, nature of the shoreline, and the cleanup policies that were implemented.  Cleanup was completed and all beaches except St. Guirec were in use by early July.  Damages and costs incurred during cleanup exceeded $50 million.

The vessel had been en route from the Arabian Gulf to Le Havre, France when it encountered stormy weather which contributed to the grounding.  The entire cargo of 1,619,048 barrels, spilled into the sea.  A slick 18 miles wide and 80 miles long polluted approximately 200 miles of Brittany coastline.  Beaches of 76 different Breton communities were oiled.The isolated location of the grounding and rough seas restricted cleanup efforts for the two weeks following the incident.  Severe weather resulted in the complete break up of the ship before any oil could be pumped out of the wreck.  As mandated in the ""Polmar Plan"", the French Navy was responsible for all offshore operations while the Civil Safety Service was responsible for shore cleanup activities.

The Pacific Glory caught fire, and was taken under tow as firefighting tugs tried to control the fire.  Explosions ruptured a starboard tank, and led to the flooding of the engine space.  The next day, the tanker began to settle and eventually touched bottom at a point four miles from the shore.  The Allegro continued on from the collision site under her own power.  The initial leak stopped soon after the collision, but as explosions occurred on the Pacific Glory additional leaks started from a starboard tank.  The tank contained 35,400 barrels of Nigerian crude oil.  Some of the oil burned, but approximately 24,780 barrels of oil spilled from the tank, forming three slicks.

Ships of the Royal Navy carrying detergents were en route to the scene within four hours of the grounding.The response command post was established at Plymouth.  The Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy implemented an early warning system for oil movement.  A panel of expert scientists was assembled to consider scientific problems involved with the cleanup procedure.  Local authorities were instrumental in dealing with the oil beached within their jurisdictions.A detergent, primarily BP1002, was sprayed on much of the floating oil to emulsify and disperse it.  Manual methods were used for removal of oil on many of the sandy beaches, although the dissected nature of the shoreline made it impossible to clean the whole coastline.

The vessel began to leak cargo from the damaged bow section.  Due to the threat of explosion and fire, the Port Commandant ordered the Urquiola out of the harbor, away from the refinery and town of 200,000 inhabitants.  While being assisted out of the harbor by two tugs, the leaking vessel grounded again, further rupturing the bow tanks.  All of the crew, except for the captain and pilot, abandoned the ship when it began to list.Two hours later the vessel exploded, killing the captain.  Approximately 513,000 barrels of oil burned in the subsequent 16-hour fire.  Burning oil spread out from the vessel and was eventually extinguished by the cooling effect of the seawater.  Dense clouds of smoke were blown over the town of La Coruña.  A safety zone one mile in radius was established around the vessel after air monitors detected high levels of volatile gases.  Despite these precautions, a second explosion and fire rocked the vessel on the morning of May 14.Between May 12 and May 21, oil was estimated to be leaking at a rate of 2,200 barrels per day.  An estimated 180,000-220,000 barrels of the cargo polluted the Spanish coast.  On May 21, a smaller tanker and tug began lightering the Urquiola.  About 50,000 barrels of crude oil had been removed from the vessel by May 25, when lightering operations were halted by rough seas.  Ten to fifteen foot seas detached a large section of the bow.  On June 8, the stern section, containing an estimated 22,000 barrels of bunker fuel, was towed to a more protected area five miles to the west.  The stern was partially lightered before developing a crack in one of the tanks that resulted in further, limited leakage.Following the fire, the Spanish Navy and a fleet of commercial vessels applied over 2,000 tons of chemical dispersants to the Urquiola and surrounding waters in spite of resistance mounted by Spanish oceanographers.  Cleanup of the oiled shoreline was primarily accomplished by manual labor.  Skimmers and booms were used for water recovery with mixed results.
